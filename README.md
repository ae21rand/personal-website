# Lexi Randt – Personal Website 

This is my personal website and portfolio, originally created as the final project for my UX Design class. 
I plan to continue expanding this site beyond the class as I grow my portfolio.
Until its completion, feel free to check out my other personal site: lexirandt.weebly.com
